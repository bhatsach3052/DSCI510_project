First, the project involves fetching data from the web for current stock parameters, and the use of yahoo finance API for fetching the history of the stock prices. With the use of the data collected, it is analyzed, and a prediction is made based on various parameters like current stock price, Revenue and growth projections from recent quarterly results, latest market trend, company financials, etc. The tool will provide the trend of the stock based on different timelines (Yearly, quarterly, monthly, and weekly). Based on these values, along with an estimation of stock value, a suggestion is made to the user based on the current value of the stock. This prediction is compared with the analysis made by other top stock analysts which is fetched from a market analysis website to weigh the accuracy of the tool.
